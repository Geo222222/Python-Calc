# 🧮 Python Calc – Command Line Calculator

## 🧾 Overview

This project is a simple command-line calculator built with Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator continuously prompts for user input and handles invalid input gracefully.

This project demonstrates basic control flow, input handling, and arithmetic logic in Python.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard libraries: `sys`, `math` (if extended)
- Command-line interface

## 🔢 Features

- Performs the four basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Supports continuous operation until the user exits
- Input validation to catch errors like division by zero
- Option to clear or reset inputs (if implemented)
